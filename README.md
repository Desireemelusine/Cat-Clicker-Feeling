# Welcome to Cat Cliker Feelings!

The project goal is to develop an app from zero, with MOV (Model-View-Controller).
It was very challenging, but at the end I got surprised with the results,  the understandable code and knowing that it's the perfect way to build an app because it allows you to  upgrade the app, find possible bug and change without interfering the  rest of the code.

### What it was done:
* HTML with 3 parts: list view, image view and premium (the user can change the photo and the info)
* CSS - I didn't give to much attention so I did something simple
* JS - MOV ( model: JSON | octopus: the link between model and view)

##### The Cat Cliker Feeling App
The idea was very simple. A list of 6 cats, when the user clicks on the cat, it shows the image of the cat and the counter will increment its value each time the user clicks on the image.
For the  premium pro - the user can exchange one cat for his own cat, with the url image, name, text and score.

### Something to consider when you read the code
You will see a lot of comments on javascript on each step. It was intended to keep it so I can always read and it's a great way to read a code after some months or years.

Enjoy!
